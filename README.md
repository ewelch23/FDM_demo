# FDM_demo
Consider a constant-area cylinder undergoing heat diffusion. The ends of the rod have constant temperatures.
Running main2.py, one can obtain results for this problem using the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th order of the Finite Differences Method.
The rate of convergence for each method is also shown. The FDM is handled in FDM_functions, while main2 is mostly for tables, graphing, and establishing parameters and so on.
This code is meant to be a demonstration of a particular example, so it may not apply to all problems.
